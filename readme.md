NOTES: As this is a locally-run simulation there aren't any race conditions to consider,
but if this was deployed onto the internet with multiple users, issues might arise with the dialog list.
To be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with race conditions beyond the couple of pages about it in my coding book.

Also if given more time, I could possibly build a live version of this with node.js and mongodb.

To run the simulation locally, clone the github repo, navigate to the folder in your terminal, and type "python3 mud.py".

Thank you!
